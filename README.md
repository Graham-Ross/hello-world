# hello-world

My name is Graham Ross. I'm 24 years old, soon to be 25, and am currently studying Chemical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I have a lot of hobbies to occupy the near-existenceless free time I have, which is clearly a very fun aspect of my life to be balancing. I decided to join GitHub as an opportunity to sort of light a fire under my bum to get back into computer programming.

-Peace and love, Graham
